# Security Rules

## 1. Purpose
This document summarizes the key cybersecurity rules and protection logic of RecruitGuard-CHD. It is intended to keep implementation aligned with the thesis security design and to guide consistent enforcement across modules.

---

## 2. Core Security Principles
- Secure-by-design
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability within prototype scope
- Accountability
- Non-repudiation
- Least privilege
- Defense-in-depth
- Trust minimization
- Evidence integrity
- Controlled disclosure

---

## 3. Authentication and Identity Verification Rules

### Internal Users
- Internal users must authenticate before accessing protected system pages.
- Only active internal accounts may authenticate successfully.
- Passwords must be stored using secure hashing.
- Session handling must reduce reuse or misuse of authenticated access.

### Applicants
- Applicant submission is accountless.
- OTP verification is required before final submission is accepted.
- OTP records must be stored in hashed form.
- OTP must expire after the defined validity window.
- Final submission must be blocked if OTP is invalid, expired, or incomplete.

---

## 4. Access Control Rules

### Role-Based Access Control
- Access must be enforced server-side.
- Users may access only the functions, pages, and records appropriate to their role.
- The locked roles are:
  - Secretariat
  - HRM Chief
  - HRMPSB Member
  - Appointing Authority
  - System Administrator

### System Administrator Restriction
- System Administrator must not have default access to recruitment case content unless explicitly permitted by system rules.

### Stage-Bound Access
- Access may be limited further by the current workflow stage.
- Stage-restricted actions must not be exposed or permitted prematurely.

---

## 5. Routing Security Rules

### Level-Aware Routing
- Level 1 cases must be assigned to the Secretariat.
- Level 2 cases must be assigned to the HRM Chief.
- Secretariat must be blocked from processing Level 2 cases.

### COS Routing Rule
- The same Level 1 / Level 2 routing logic may be applied to COS as an internal office control.

### Override Rule
- Routing override is not automatic.
- If implemented, it must:
  - be authorized
  - be controlled
  - be audit-logged

---

## 6. Workflow Integrity Rules

### Stage Progression
- Stage progression must be enforced by the system.
- Stage skipping is not allowed.
- Stage advancement must require defined prerequisites.

### Stage Locking
- Finalized outputs may be stage-locked where applicable.
- Stage-locked records must not be editable through normal actions.
- Reopening must be controlled and audit-logged.

### Branch-Aware Rules
- Plantilla uses the stricter policy-aware path.
- COS uses a lighter flexible path.
- COS must not be forced into a rigid Plantilla-identical path.

---

## 7. Confidentiality Rules

### In Transit
- Data in transit must be protected using HTTPS/TLS in deployment.

### At Rest
- Selected sensitive stored data may be protected using AES-256-GCM or equivalent authenticated encryption.
- Encryption is for confidentiality and is separate from integrity hashing.

### Visibility Control
- Sensitive records must be visible only to authorized roles and only under appropriate workflow conditions.

---

## 8. Evidence Integrity Rules

### Recruitment Artifacts
- Recruitment files and generated artifacts must be stored in the Evidence Vault.
- Each artifact must preserve metadata such as case, stage, uploader, and timestamp.

### Hashing
- SHA-256 hash values must be generated and stored for evidence-related files where applicable.

### Version Preservation
- Evidence versions must be preserved without silent overwrite.
- Replacements or updates must produce a traceable version record.

---

## 9. Audit Logging Rules

### Required Audit Elements
Audit events should preserve:
- actor identity
- actor role
- action performed
- timestamp
- case reference
- workflow stage
- relevant details

### Critical Logged Events
The following categories must be logged where applicable:
- account and role changes
- recruitment entry creation/update/status changes
- applicant submission finalization
- routing actions and overrides
- stage finalization
- reopen actions
- screening finalization
- exam-related actions
- rating submission
- deliberation finalization
- CAR generation/finalization
- final decision recording
- notification events where traceability is needed
- export generation
- sensitive access events
- audit-log viewing where applicable

---

## 10. Export and Controlled Disclosure Rules

### Export Control
- Export must be allowed only to authorized roles.
- Export requests must be audit-logged.

### Export Bundle Requirements
Export bundles should include, where applicable:
- required recruitment records and outputs
- evidence inventory
- integrity verification output

### Disclosure Handling
- Export is treated as a controlled disclosure surface.
- Unauthorized export must be blocked.

---

## 11. Availability Rules Within Prototype Scope
- The system should remain stable during scheduled evaluation sessions.
- The academic prototype does not include destructive testing.
- Denial-of-service testing and brute-force campaigns are out of scope.
- Availability assessment is limited to controlled prototype conditions.

---

## 12. Scope Constraints
- Recruitment only
- Full onboarding is out of scope
- Offboarding, termination, payroll, and full employee lifecycle management are out of scope
- Use dummy or synthetic data only during development, testing, and evaluation

---

## 13. Developer Reminders
- Never hard-code secrets
- Use environment variables for:
  - Django secret key
  - DB credentials
  - email credentials
  - encryption keys
- Keep access enforcement server-side
- Keep audit logging consistent across modules
- Keep Plantilla and COS branch behavior intentionally distinguishable
