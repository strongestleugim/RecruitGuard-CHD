# RecruitGuard-CHD Functional Requirements Specification

## 1. System Overview

RecruitGuard-CHD is a secure-by-design web-based recruitment management system for DOH–CHD CALABARZON. It supports both *Plantilla* and *Contract of Service (COS)* recruitment within one shared platform, one shared database, and one shared workflow engine. The system applies *branch-aware workflow handling* so that Plantilla and COS are not forced into one identical linear process. It also applies *level-aware internal routing* so that recruitment cases are assigned according to the recorded position level or routing basis.

### Direct Actors
- Applicant
- Secretariat
- HRM Chief
- HRMPSB Member
- Appointing Authority
- System Administrator

### Level-Aware Routing Rule
- Level 1 -> Secretariat
- Level 2 -> HRM Chief
- Secretariat must not process Level 2 cases
- Controlled routing override is allowed only if explicitly implemented and audit-logged

### COS Rule
COS remains a *lighter flexible path* than Plantilla. It does not introduce a new actor beyond the locked actor set and will be handled by the existing internal roles, primarily the Secretariat and HRM Chief.

### Scope Boundary
The system is bounded to *recruitment handling only*. Full onboarding, offboarding, payroll, termination, and general employee lifecycle management are out of scope.

- Python cryptography for AES-256-GCM
- ReportLab
- Python zipfile

Future deployment target:

- Nginx
- Gunicorn

Security testing tools:

## 3. Global Functional Principles

### 3.1 Shared Platform Principle
The system operates as one shared recruitment platform supporting both Plantilla and COS workflows.

### 3.2 Branch-Aware Workflow Principle
The system applies different internal workflow rules for Plantilla and COS while preserving one workflow engine.

### 3.3 Level-Aware Routing Principle
The system uses level classification or routing basis as an internal workflow control for case handling.

### 3.4 Role-Based Access Principle
The system enforces role-based access so that each internal actor sees and performs only the functions relevant to that role.

### 3.5 Stage-Based Workflow Principle
The system enforces stage progression and prevents stage skipping unless explicitly allowed by controlled system rules.

### 3.6 Evidence Integrity Principle
The system preserves uploaded and generated records as controlled recruitment artifacts with metadata, version preservation, and integrity support.

### 3.7 Accountability Principle
The system records security-relevant and workflow-relevant actions in an audit trail.

- Plantilla and COS are supported within one shared system but not through one identical linear workflow.
- COS remains a lighter flexible branch.
- No additional End-user actor is introduced in the locked design.
- COS handling remains under the current internal roles, primarily the Secretariat and HRM Chief.
- Background investigation is not included as a standalone function in the locked current plan.
- Full onboarding is out of scope.
- Security validation uses a controlled staging environment and dummy or synthetic data only.
